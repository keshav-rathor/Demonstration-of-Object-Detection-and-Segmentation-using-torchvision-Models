This code repository showcases the application of advanced computer vision techniques using the torchvision library within the PyTorch framework. It demonstrates how to perform object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation on images. The code covers the usage of prominent models like Faster R-CNN, FCN (Fully Convolutional Network), and Mask R-CNN. Each technique is described in detail and supported by visualizations to help users understand and implement these techniques effectively. The repository serves as an educational resource for those interested in exploring state-of-the-art computer vision models and their practical applications. It's a valuable reference for enthusiasts and practitioners aiming to enhance their understanding of computer vision tasks and deep learning in the context of visual data analysis.
